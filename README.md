# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Start local dev server
npm run dev:server

Your server should now be running at http://locahost:3001 and you will now have two users in your MongoDB database!

## Populated Database Data

Once you run the `populate-db` script, you should have two users in your database:

### Tony Stark

- First Name: `Tony`
- Last Name: `Stark`
- Email: `tony@stark.com`
- Password: `password123`

### Steve Rogers

- First Name: `Steve`,
- Last Name: `Rogers`,
- Email: `steve@rogers.com`,
- Password: `password456`

## API Documentation

To learn more about how the API works, once you have started your local environment, you can visit: http://localhost:3001/api-docs

## Design Assets

Static HTML and CSS has been created for most of the site and is located in: `/designs`.

For some of the dynamic features, like toggling user editing, there is a mock-up for it in `/designs/wireframes/edit-user-name.png`.

And for the API model that you will be proposing for transactitons, the wireframe can be found in `/designs/wireframes/transactions.png`.
